#No Man's Sky Countdown

[Visible on GitHub pages](http://secretonline.github.io/NMS-Countdown).

A countdown until No Man's Sky is released.

Well, it would be a countdown if we knew the release date. As soon as we have a date, we will have a countdown.  
In the mean time, there's a countdown to the next IGN First video you can watch instead.

> we have a goddamn countdown to a video that is going to be 5 minutes long talking about one feature of no man's sky. Damn we are drug addicts and scraping the bottom of the barrel. less than 6 hours though ;)
